# STT-Arabic
This project simply takes spoken Arabic words into Arabic text.
Using HTML, a simple page is created to show an interface for the user. From this page, we can press a button
to allow us to start speaking, and then the user will be asked for permission to record their microphone.

After this, using a javascript file to import from google APIs, this can provide a list of methods to use in 
voice recognition and translation from speech into text.
